If you don't have nitro, post the emojis as links!<br>

Install it by downloading the DiscordFreeEmoji.plugin.js file to plugins folder.<br>

A fork of An00nymushun's original: https://github.com/An00nymushun/DiscordFreeEmojis <br>

Changes made:
- (Breaking Bug) emoji.url no longer exists, url is created dynamically based on if emoji is animated gif or still webp
- (QOL) Url is inserted as a hyperlink on an invisible character (should be invisible everywhere, thank [@NamelessContributor](https://github.com/NamelessContributor))
- (QOL) Multiple of the same emoji can be used in the same message (thank [@ArjhanToteck](https://github.com/ArjhanToteck))
- (Pref) Emojis can be displayed in native size or 48px (open the settings and toggle off "Use native emoji size", thank [@ArjhanToteck](https://github.com/ArjhanToteck) and [@DanzoGit](https://github.com/DanzoGit))
- (QOL) CSS styles to hide nitro emoji ads (and other misc items) (thank [@thc282](https://github.com/thc282) for adding the CSS styles into the code)


I intend to maintain this repo as I use the plugin. I will consider any PRs or issues.
